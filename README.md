# Anup Rijal Personal Site (index.html)

This ZIP contains a redesigned, accessible, and sleek single-page `index.html` for anuprijal.com.

## What's inside
- `index.html` — Self-contained page with Aurora Night palette, animated gradient background, and dot grid.
- `README.md` — Notes and deployment steps.

## Deploy
1. Back up your current site files.
2. Replace your existing `index.html` on the server with this one.
3. Ensure linked pages exist: `projects.html`, `ai.html`, `blog1.html`.
4. Optional: Add a favicon (e.g., `/favicon.ico`).
5. Test on mobile & desktop. Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
